parse so that...

accessing URL:
- indexOf 

if line starts with <p

want to:

find + get author name 
find + get the wrong URL?
generate the right URL
replace wrong URLS with the right URLS

1. getting the author name: 

end of file : NAME </a></p>
    is there any way to get that last part
    iterate backwards?
        from end index - 8 (9)?
        to ">" --> store index
        get first to last index --> name
        name.toLowercase(), name.split(" ")
    
    - find /"> 


doesn't work;sadfajksfslkfj
